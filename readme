## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone this repository** or copy the files:

```
git clone https://github.com/OuhabYouceff/IHEC
cd chat-ihec
```
Install dependencies (inside a virtualenv is recommended):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure Ollama is installed and running:
Install Ollama: https://ollama.com/download

```
ollama run qwen2.5:latest
```

▶️ Running the App

```
streamlit run app.py
```

🧠 How it Works
You upload .pdf or .txt files via the sidebar.

The app chunks and embeds the content using OllamaEmbeddings.

It stores embeddings in a FAISS vector store.

When you ask a question, it retrieves the top 3 relevant chunks.

It sends these chunks + your question to llama3 via LangChain/Ollama.

It streams the response back to you in the chat — with avatars and memory.


📌 Example Prompt
💬 "Quels sont les clubs disponibles à l'IHEC Carthage ?"

✅ The app will answer in French and display the context it used to answer.
